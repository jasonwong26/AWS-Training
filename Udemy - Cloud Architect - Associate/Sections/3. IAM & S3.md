# Section 3: Identity Access Management & S3

## 8. IAM 101
IAM stands for Identity Access Management

Users - human end users
Groups - collection of users
Roles - Non-human users (eg. virtual machine, lambda method, etc.)
Policies - permissions assigned to a user, group, or role

TODO:
- secure root account for AWS with MFA DONE
- add password change schedule         WON'T DO
- research AWS IAM policies by job function (dba, billing, etc.) [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html)

Test question: how to set up billing alarm
- CloudWatch
- Billing => create Alert
  - add criteria
  - add SNS for delivery

## 11. S3 101

S3 uses global namespace
Amazon guarantees (11 x 9s 99.99...) uptime.
Tiered Storage (important test question)
Lifecycle management - can transition files to lower level service after ## days

File size range: 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes

You can add MFA for specific actions (like deleting an object)

Storage Classes
Standard
- 99.99 available
- 11 x 9 durability (ensuring content data is not corrupted)

S3 - IA (infrequently accessed)
- lower cost than standard
- but charged fee on retrieval

S3 One Zone - IA
- lower cost
- does not store across multiple zones

S3 - Intelligent Tiering
- uses machine learning to transition files

S3 - Glacier
- use for archive data for long-term

S3 - Glacier Deep Archive
- lowest cost
- retrieval time is 12 hours

Cross Region Replication
- replicate bucket to another region (US to Australia)

S3 Transfer Acceleration
- effectively CloudFront caching

IMPORTANT: Read over S3 FAQs before exam as a refresher.
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/

## 12. Let's Create an S3 Bucket

## 13. S3 Pricing Tiers

Cost components of S3
- Storage
- Retrieval
- Data Transfer
- Management & Replication

Intelligent Tiering includes a cost for monitoring.
- cost per 1000 objects
- best for smaller numbers of large objects

Recommendation
- use Intelligent Tiering by default
- single region IA if redundency is not important
- glacier / deep glacier for infrequently acessed / archive data

## 14. S3 Security and Encryption

Can set up access logs for tracking access

Server Side Encryption otions
- S3 Managed Keys (AWS handles all of encryption)
- AWS Key Management Service (Customer key hosted via AWS Key service)
- Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (customer responsibiliity)
- Client side encryption (upload pre-encrypted files)

NOTE: looked like S3 Managed Keys uses a single key for ALL S3 Buckets.

## 15. S3 Versioning Control
MFA Delets are connected to versioning feature

Making a file version public does not make other versionso of the same file public.
(think of each as a seaparate object)

Deleting in a version controled S3 bucket just hides rather than deletes.
There is a secondary delete that fully deletes the file.

Versioning cannot be disabled, it can only be suspended
(doesn't remove versioned copies of files.

## 16. S3 Lifecycle management and Glacier
Management => Lifecycle Rules

Automates movement of objects between storage tiers
Can be done in combination with versioning (but doesn't need to be)

## 17. S3 Lock Policies and Glacier Vault Policies

S3 object lock enables (WORM) restrictions on objects (write once read many)
- prevents accidental editing or deleting of documents

Governance Mode (restrict permissions to specific users)
Compliance Mode (locked to all users)

Glacier Vault policies affect the vault itself and cannot be changed once set.

## 18. S3 Performance
Splitting S3 objects across multiple folders (they call them prefixes) improves performance
- Each prefix has a cap on number of simultaneous reads/writes
- So splitting across multiple increases performance
- Prefix examples:
  - /folder/subfolder/
  - /folder/subfolder2/
  - /folder2/

Limitation when using encryption via KMS
- must call encrypt/decrypt when uploading/downloading
- much lower cap on number of calls per second

Other ways to improve performance
- multipart uploads
 - recommended for files > 100 MB
 - required for files > 5 GB

S3 Byte-Range Fetches
- parallel download (equivalent to multi-part upload)
- can also be used download parts of a file
  - example: checking PDF version

Exam Tips
Performance cap (by prefix)
- 5,500 GET, HEAD requests
- 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests

With KMS
- Region specific limits
- one of: 5,500, 10,000, or 30,000

## 19. S3 Select and Glacier Select
SQL for S3
- allows you to pull a portion of a file (like a CSV file) using SQL syntax

## 20. AWS Organizations
AWS Organizations is a service option (same S3, DynamoDB, etc.)

Difference between IAM Group vs AWS Organzation OU
- Group is like a Role that a user is assigned
- OU is just like an OU in Active Directory

Basically same as OUs in active directory / Azure.

Added note: consolidated billing
- create a separate user for each client
- so long as they are all under the same master account all charges will be aggregated

Required for sharing S3 buckets across accounts (presumably only in console)

## 21. Sharing S3 Buckets across accounts

3 ways to share
- via Bucket Policies and IAM (programmatic access only)
- via Bucket ACLs (Access Control Lists) and IAM (programmatic access only)
- Cross-Account IAM roles (programmatic AND console access)

## 22. Cross Region Replication
Management => Replication Rules

- Requires versioning on both buckets
- Can specify a different storage tier in target bucket
- does not copy object permissions (replicating a public object does not mean it is public in the target bucket)
- Delete markers are not replicated
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers are not replicated

Only works with new objects once turned on (does not affect existing objects)

## 23. Transfer Acceleration
Uses CloudFront distribution network to allow users to upload to a local server, it then gets forwarded to the S3 bucket.

Didn't show how to turn it on.
But you will get a separate URL for users to upload files to.

## 24. DataSync Overview
Mass data migration service to move data from on-Prem servers to AWS cloud

- usable with NFS and SMB filesystems
- Can be set on schedule, replicating on daily, weekly, etc. schedule
- install DataSync agent
- Can be used from EFS to EFS (imagine 2 EC2 instances)

## 25. CloudFront Overview

Key Terms
- Edge Location (edge server cluster)
- Origin: Origin of all files CDN will distribute (S3 bucket, EC2 instance, Route 53, etc.)

Types of distributions:
- Web Distribution - for websites
- RTMP - for streaming

CloudFront servers aren't read only - you can upload to them as well (review Transfer Acceleration section)

Objects are cached for TTL (Time to Live), tracked in seconds
You are able to clear cached objects

## 26. CloudFront Lab
CloudFront is global not regional (duh)

## 27. CloudFront Signed URL's and Cookies
Use Signed URL for individual files
Use Signned Cookies for multiple files (example: access all premium content for a website)

To assign Signed URL/Cookie
- Create Policy (specify lifetime, etc.)

OAI (Origin Access Identity)

Accessing premium content workflow:
- User authenticates to client website
- website generates signed URL or Cookie
- website access CloudFront using signed URL or Cookie
- CloudFront checks signature against policy
- If valid, retrieves cached object or pulls from origin (S3, etc.)
- returns object

S3 also has signed URLs
- limited lifetime
- linked to IAM user who created bucket
- only accessible by users who have access to the bucket via AWS Console

## 28. Snowball Overview
Petabyte-scale data transport solution

Way to import/export very large data transfers

two sizes:
50 Terabytes
80 Terabytes

includes 256 bit encryption, industry standard security

Snowball Edge
100 Terabyte size
includes computations (supports Lambda)
like a small, local AWS server

Snowmobile
Exabyte scale data transfer service
similar to other Snow products, but semi-truck sized server.

Can import/export from S3

## 30. Storage Gateway
connects on-premise software appliance with cloud-based storage.
Bridge between on-prem to AWS, replication model.

File Gateway
- copies files to S3 buckets

Volume Gateway
- copies snapshots of disk drives to S3
- asyncronous
- two variations
  - Stored Volumes - entire dataset stored onsite and asyncronously backed up to S3
  - Cached Volumes - only most frequently accessed data stored onsite, full dataset stored on S3

Tape Gateway
- replaces tape based backups

## 31. Athena vs. Macie
### Athena
What is
- Interactive service to query S3 data using SQL syntax
- serverless, pay by usage

When to use:
- query log files
- generate business reports on data in S3
- run queries on stream data in S3

Comparison vs S3 Select
- S3 Select is for pulling part of a single object
- Athena allows queries across multiple objects

### Macie
What is
- machine learning based
- detects PII data in S3

When to use
- identify when S3 contains sensitive data
- Can be used to analyze CloudTrail logs for suspicious API activity
- Ensure PII Compliance

## 32. IAM and S3 Summary
Review this prior to exam

S3 One Zone - IA
 - use this for data that can be easily recreated if lost

Tiers of Users
- Administrator (includes IAM management)> Power User (excludes IAM management)

S3 Availability:
- One Zone - IA has less availability than standard S3 (due to servers being down for maintenance and another location not covering the outage)

S3 URL styles for accessing content
- Virtual hosted Style: https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/example.txt
- Path hosted Style: https://s3.Region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/example.txt
- Legacy Global Endpoint: https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/example.txt
- Static Web Site URL:
  - http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com/example.txt
  - http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com/example.txt

there is a cap on the number of S3 buckets an account can have (100)
