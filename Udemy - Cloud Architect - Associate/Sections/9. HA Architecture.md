## 103. Load Balancers Theory

Application Load Balancer
- designed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- operate at Layer 7
- application aware (can see into applicaiton content)

Network Load Balancer
- best for TCP traffic where extreme performance is needed
- Operates at layer 4 (connection level)

Classic Load Balancer
- legacy elastic load balancer
- not application aware
- if application stops responding, you will get a 504 error

Logging client IP addresses
- look for X-Forwarded-For address (base IP will be the load balancer)

## 104. Load Balancers and Health Checks
Exam Tips
- 3 types of load balancers
- 504 error means gateway timed out (applicaiton didn't respond)
- look for `X-Forwarded-For` attribute to see client IP
- ELB uses health checks to determine whether resources are available (uses values: InService | OutofService)
- Exam Prep: read FAQs for all Load Balancers

## 105. Advanced Load Balancer Theory
Sticky Sessions
- use when you are writing files to the EC2 instance

Cross Zone Load Balancing
- adjusts traffic based on available resources within each AZ
- accommodates for situation where one AZ has 4 servers, the other has only 1.

Path Patterns
- useful for microservices
- direct traffic based on url path

## 106. Autoscaling Theory
3 components:

Groups
- logic component of resources
Configuration Templates
- specify template to launch additional resources as needed
Scaling Options
- rules to control when/how to spin up/down resources  (as needed, on schedule, etc.)
- options:
  - maintain levels (no scaling) - AWS will terminate unhealthy instances and launch a replacement
  - manual scaling
  - scheduled scaling
  - demand based scaling
  - predictive scaling

## 107. Autoscaling Groups

## 108. HA Architecture
Always plan for failure
Use multiple AZs and Regions
Understand difference in Multi-AZ and Read Replicas for RDS
Scaling options
- Scaling out: adding additional resources, like EC2 instances
- scaling up: adding additional capacity to an existing resource (Additional CPUs, memory)
Consider cost elements
Understand differences in S3 options

Exam Tip:
you can trigger a failover by rebooting an RDS instance with failover
