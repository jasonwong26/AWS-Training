## 130. Lambda Concepts
Scales out, not up
independent, 1 event = 1 function

AWS X-Ray service
- assists with debugging Lambda functions

## 131. Let's build a serverless Webpage
## 132. Let's build an Alexa skill
## 133. Serverless Application Model (SAM)
Apparently you don't have to specify an API gateway prior to associating it to a Lambda funciton

## 134. Elastic Container Service (ECS)
like EC2 autoscaling but for containers

AWS Fargate - serverless compute engine
- eliminates need to manage servers

When to choose EC2 over Fargate:
- compliance requirements
- full control of configuration
- require GPU resources

Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- 3rd party open source framework
- similar to serverless
- use if you are already using it

Terms to know:

Cluster
- logical collection of resources (either EC2 or Fargate)
Task Definition
- like a Dockerfile
- can contain multiple containers
Container Definition
- definition of an individual container
- stored within Task Definition
Task
- instance of a spun up Task Definition
Service
- manages scaling
Registry
- storage repository for images (ether Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or Docker Hub)

Security
- instance roles (affects all tasks on the EC2 instance)
- task roles (more fine grained, at task level)

Will spin up an entire VPC
