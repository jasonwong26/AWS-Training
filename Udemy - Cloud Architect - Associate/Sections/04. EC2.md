## 33. EC2 101
Pricing Models
- On Demand (fixed rate for time used hours or seconds)
- Reserved (significantly cheaper, typically 1-3 year contracts)
- Spot (like commodities market, you bid on server usage at a set price and can buy if available)
- Dedicated Hosts (physical EC2 hardware/VM)

### On Demand
Best for/when
- low cost and flexibility
- short term, spikey or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- no upfront cost
- testing new applications on EC2

### Reserved
- Applications with steady state or predictable usage
- Applications that require reserved capacity
- Eligible for discounts via contracts

#### Reserved Pricing Types
Standard Reserved
- offers up to 75% off
- cannot change resources

Convertable Reserved
- Up to 54% off
- can change resources

Scheduled Reserved
- Can be spun up/down on schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)

### Spot Pricing
Best for/when
- Applications with flexible start/end times
- Applications that can be interrupted
- Applications requiring very low compute costs

### Dedicated Host
Best for/when
- For regulatory requirements that disallow multi-tenant hosting
- When using licensing that does not support multi-tenant or cloud deployment

### Exam Notes
If using Spot Pricing
- if AWS cancels your instance, you will be charged only for the fraction of an hour you used
- if you cancel it yourself, you'll be charged the full hour

#### Mneumonic for remembering different EC2 types:
Fight Dr. McPixz AU - envision a scottish pixie wearing a doctor's outfit with gloves in Australia

## 34. Let's Get Our Hands Dirty with EC2 (part 1)

## 35. Let's Get OUr HAnds Dirty with EC2 (part 2)
Volume Types
- available for root drive
  - General Purpose SSD (gp2)
  - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) - increased IO capcity
  - Magnetic (standard)
- Additinonal drives only:
  - Cold HDD (sc1) - cheapest form of storage
  - Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) - good for data warehousing

Recent feature: you can now encrypt EC2 root volumes at start

### Exam Notes
- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
- On EBS-backed instance, the default action is for root EBS volume to be deleted when instance is terminated.  But additional volumes will not be deleted
- EBS Root Volumnes CAN be encrypted.  You can use third party tools to encrypt, or use AWS tools.

## 36. Security Groups Basics
Security groups control how you can connect to EC2 instance - inbound/outbound rules, etc.

NOTE: if you allow traffic in (eg. via HTTP or SSH), AWS will automatically create a matching Outbound rule

Can't block individual IP addresses or ports
Everything is whitelisted

Can apply multiple Security Groups to a single EC2 instance.

### Exam Notes
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
- All outbound traffic is allowed.
- Changes to Security groups are IMMEDIATE.
- M2M relationship between EC2 instances and Security Groups
- Security Groups are STATEFUL (allowing traffic in automatically allows traffic out)
- You cannot block specific IP Addresses (to do so, use Network Access Control Lists)
- White list rules only, no way to blacklist (but you can via Network Access Control Lists)

## 37. EBS 101
EBS = Elastic Block Store = Virtual hard disks in AWS

5 variations
- General Purpose (SSD)
- Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
- Throughput Optimized HDD
- Cold Hard Disk Drive
- Magnetic

### General Purpose (SSD)
Purpose: Most workloads
API Name: gp2 (general purpose)

### Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
Purpose: Databases
API Name: io1 (IO)

### Throughput Optimized HDD
Purpose: Low Cost HDD volumn for frequently accessed, throughput intensive
Use Case: Big Data, Data Warehouses
API Name: st1

### Cold Hard Disk Drive
Purpose: Lowest cost HDD option
Use Case: File Servers
API Name: sc1

### Magnetic
Purpose: Previous generation HDD
API Name: Standard

## 38. Volumes and Snapshots
EBS Volumes will always be colocated as the EC2 instance.

Terminating an instance will also remove the related EBS Volume (if marked for delete on terminate).
- Root volume is flagged for delete by default
- Non-Root volumes flagged to retain by default

Can modify type and size of a volume after creation.  
- NOTE: But you may need to update the OS snapshot of the drive to use the additional space.

Exam Question: how to move volume to another Availability Zone
- Create Snapshot of volume
- Create Image (abbreviation: AMI - Amazon Machine Image) from Snapshot
- Deploy Image to new Availability Zone

Exam Notes
- Volumes exist in EBS. (EBS is basically a virtual hard disk)
- Snapshots exist on S3.
- Snapshots are incremental.  Only changes since last snapshot are stored.
- Best Practice: Stop root volume before taking snapshot
- But you can take snapshot while drive is in use.
- You can change volume type and size on the fly

## 39. AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)
### EBS Volume
From an EBS snapshot

### Instance STore
From a AMI template stored on S3
Can't view in Volume list
Has different set of controls and features than EBS
Terminating the instance will delete the volume as well.

### Exam Tips
Instance Store Volumes are also called 'Ephemeral Storage'
Instance Store volumes cannot be stopped.  If the hardware fails you will lose data.
Instance STore - Cannot instruct AWS to retain root volume.

EBS Volume can be stopped and will not lose data.
EBS Root Volume can be retained (though not default behaviour)

## 40. ENI vs ENA vs EFA
ENI - Elasatic Network Interface
EN  - Enhanced Networking
EFA - Elastic Fabric Adaptor

### ENI
included automatically with EC2 instance
can add additional ENI to an EC2 instance

Use for:
- basic networking (default option)
- use multiple ENI to create separate networks at low cost

### EN
- offers enhanced networking performance
- uses SR-IOV (single root I/O virtualization)
- two methodologies
  - ENA (Elastic Network Adapter), supports speeds up to 100 GPS
  - VF (Virtual Function), supports speads up to 10 GPS (legacy option)

### EFA
- Use this for High Performance Computing and Machine Learning
- Uses OS Bypass to improve performance

## 41. Encrypted Root Device Volumnes & Snapshots
Can encrypt volume at start (relatively new AWS feature)

### Process to encrypt an existing volume
1. Create Snapshot of Volume
2. Copy Snapshot, and check the 'Encrypt Snapshot' option
3. Use encrypted snapshot to create an Image (AMI)
4. Use new AMI to launch a new EC2 instance

### Exam Tips
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
- You can share snapshots ONLY if they are unencrypted
- Unencrypted snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
- You can encrypt an EC2 instance on creation
- Review process to encrypt an existing process above

## 42. Spot Instances & Spot Fleets
Spot Instances can be as much as 90% cheaper than On-Demand prices.

When to use:
- flexible applications

When not to use:
- Persistent Workloads
- Crticial Jobs
- Databases

Examples given:
- High Performance Computing
- Big Data Analytics
- Containerized workloads
- CI/CD and testing
- Image and Media rendering
- Web Services (questionable)

You can set `Spot Blocks` to prevent your Spot instance from being terminated if the price goes above your max price.

### Spot Fleets
A collection of Spot Instances and optionally, On-Demand Instances

It's designed for you to set a target capacity, and where possible use Spot Instances and fill the remainder with On-Demand Instances.

You can set up multiple pools within a fleet.

Possible strategies
- capacityOptimiazed - focus on reaching capacity
- lowestPrice - focus on lowest price
- diversified - spin up Spot Instances across all pools within a fleet
- instancPoolsToUseCount - distribute across specied # of pools, only available along with `lowestPrice` strategy

### Exam Tips
- Can save up to 90% vs On-Demand Instances
- Useful for situations where you don't need persistent storage
- You can block instance termination using `Spot Block`
- A Spot Fleet is a collection of Spot Instances (and possibly On-Demand Instances)

## 43. EC2 Hibernate

Service to speed up instance boot times.  Stores in memory state rather than spinning the operating system down/up.

Steps when you start an EC2 instance
- Operationg system boots up
- Bootstrap scripts are run (install software, apply settings, etc.)
- Applications Start

With Hibernate, the operation system is put in hibernation to reduce time needed to get to Application Start.
- Store current memory state inside root volume
- On restart, load RAM into memory and resume processing

### Requirements
- Encryption on root volume
- additional reserved space on root volume so memory can be saved during hibernation
- RAM must be less than 150 GB
- cannot hibernate for more than 60 days

### Exam Tips
- Preserves in-memory RAM to EBS during hibernation
- not supported by all instance setups (but many listed)
- RAM must be less than 150 GB
- cannot hibernate for more than 60 days
- Available to On-Demand and Reserved Instances

## 44. AWS This Week
The Cloud Guru newsletter/blog on new AWS features.
Recommend it for keeping up to date on AWS changes.

## 45. CloudWatch 101
Host Level Metrics
- CPU
- Network
- Disk
- Status Check

Often confused with CloudTrail
- CloudTrail is an auditing tool.  Records API calls to identify which users issued changes to AWS (created S3 buckets, EC2 instances, etc.)
- CloudWatch is for monitoring performance, etc.

### Exam Tips
- CloudWatch is for
- CloudWatch will monitor EC2 every 5 minutes by default
- You can enable 1 minute intervals by turning on detailed monitoring
- You can create CloudWatch alarms which trigger notifications

## 46. CloudWatch Lab
Standard Monitoring = 5 minutes
Detailed Monitoring = 1 minute

Logs
Events
Alarms
Dashboards

Remember differecne betwene CloudWatch and CloudTrail

## 47. The AWS Command Line
Recommend using Roles instead of access key and secret key to secure access
- when using CLI from within an EC2 instance

You can do everytihng via CLI
You need to set up permissions in IAM beforehand

## 48. Using IAM Roles With EC2
Always use instance roles rather than access key and secret key
Roles are easier to manage
Roles are global
Roles can be assigned and modified after the instance is created

## 49. Using Boot Strap Scripts

## 50. EC2 Instance Meta Data
Can use curl to extract EC2 instance metadata (such as public IP address) `curl http://{ip address for instance}/latest/meta-data/`
- Then store data in file and copy to S3 bucket
- Then use Lambda to trigger programmatic changes based on the file landing in S3
- results in automation related to EC2 instances.

## 51. Elastic File System
Cannot share EBS volumes across multiple EC2 instances
CAN share EFS volume
EFS can automatically grow or shrink in size as needed.

Set EFS in a separate security group that only allows NFS protocol.  That will allow your EC2 instances to connect via NFS (and disallows other types of access).

### Exam Tips
- Supports NFSv4 protocol (Network File System version 4)
- Only pay for storage used
- Can scale to petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Stored across multiple AZs in a reagion
- Read after Write consistency

## 52. FSX for Windows & FSX for Lustre
FSx - windows native file server

FSX for Windows differences vs EFS
- SMB protocol based (Windows based) vs NFS protocol (linux based)

FSX for Lustre
File system optimized for compute-intensive workloads 
- high-performance computing
- machine learning
- etc
Very high performance
Can store files to S3

### Exam Tips
Use EFS for most situations (all Linux)
Use FSx for Windows for Windows operating (look for SMB keyword)
Use FSx for Lustre for big data, high performance computing, etc.

## 53. EC2 Placement Groups
3 types
- Clustered
- Spread
- Partitioned

### Clustered
Grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone
- use for low network latency, high network throughput

### Spread
Instances placed on separate racks for durability
- use for critical instances that should be kept separate
- Difference vs Partitioned (single instance per rack)

### Partitioned
Instances in Group are broken by partition, each partition on separate rack
- Difference vs Spread (multiple instances per rack)

### Exam Tips
- clustered placement group cannnot span multiple Availaiblity Zones (duh)
- Name for placement group must be unique within your AWS account
- Only certain types of instances can be launched in a a Placement Group (excludes general purpose)
- AWS recommmends the same instance type wihtin clustered placement groups
- You cannot merge placement groups
- You CAN move an instance into a placement group.  But it must be stopped, and this must be done via CLI or SDK (not supported by AWS Console.

## 54. HPC on AWS
High Performance Compute

Services that support HPC:

### Data Transfer
- Snowball, Snowmobile
- AWS DataSync
- Direct Connect (a dedicated network connection from on-prem to AWS)

### Compute and Networking
- EC2 instances that are CPU or GPU optimized
- EC2 fleets (Spot Instances, Spot Fleets)
- Placement Groups (cluster placement groups)
- Enhanced networking (SR-IOV)
- Elastic Network Adapters (ENA or VF)
  - NOTE: VF is legacy product only, choose ENA by default)
- EFA - Elastic Fabric Adapters

### Storage
- Instance Attached Storage (EBs, Instance Store)
- S3, EFS, FSx for Lustre

### Orchestration & Automation
- AWS Batch - service to manage jobs running across multiple EC2 instances
- AWS ParallelCluster - manage HPC clusters

## 55. AWS WAF
Web Application Firewall

3 behaviours
- Blacklist specified requests
- Whitelist specified requests
- Provide metrics based on properties specified

### Exam Tips
Use WAF when
- block malicious IP addresses
- detect/stop sql injection

## 56. EC2 Summary
Review prior to exam

## Quiz
- Spread placement groups have maximum of 7 instances per Availability Zone
- Reserved EC2 instances cannot be moved from one region to another
- The url http://169.254.169.254 for retrieveing metadata is standard across all instances (it isn't the public IP address of the instance).  Can be asked about on test.
- You CAN attach an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances
