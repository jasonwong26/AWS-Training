## 103. Load Balancers Theory
[FAQ link](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/faqs/)

Application Load Balancer
- designed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- operate at Layer 7
- application aware (can see into applicaiton content)

Network Load Balancer
- best for TCP traffic where extreme performance is needed
- Operates at layer 4 (connection level)

Classic Load Balancer
- legacy elastic load balancer
- not application aware
- if application stops responding, you will get a 504 error

Logging client IP addresses
- look for X-Forwarded-For address (base IP will be the load balancer)

## 104. Load Balancers and Health Checks
Exam Tips
- 3 types of load balancers
- 504 error means gateway timed out (applicaiton didn't respond)
- look for `X-Forwarded-For` attribute to see client IP
- ELB uses health checks to determine whether resources are available (uses values: InService | OutofService)
- Exam Prep: read FAQs for all Load Balancers

## 105. Advanced Load Balancer Theory
Sticky Sessions
- use when you are writing files to the EC2 instance

Cross Zone Load Balancing
- adjusts traffic based on available resources within each AZ
- accommodates for situation where one AZ has 4 servers, the other has only 1.

Path Patterns
- useful for microservices
- direct traffic based on url path

## 106. Autoscaling Theory
3 components:

Groups
- logic component of resources
Configuration Templates
- specify template to launch additional resources as needed
Scaling Options
- rules to control when/how to spin up/down resources  (as needed, on schedule, etc.)
- options:
  - maintain levels (no scaling) - AWS will terminate unhealthy instances and launch a replacement
  - manual scaling
  - scheduled scaling
  - demand based scaling
  - predictive scaling

## 107. Autoscaling Groups

## 108. HA Architecture
Always plan for failure
Use multiple AZs and Regions
Understand difference in Multi-AZ and Read Replicas for RDS
Scaling options
- Scaling out: adding additional resources, like EC2 instances
- scaling up: adding additional capacity to an existing resource (Additional CPUs, memory)
Consider cost elements
Understand differences in S3 options

## 109. HA Word Press Site
## 110. Setting Up EC2
## 111. Adding Resilience and Autoscaling
## 112. Cleaning Up
Exam Tip:
you can trigger a failover by rebooting an RDS instance with failover

## 113. CloudFormation
AWS maintains a number of templates that can be leveraged.
- [AWS Quick Starts](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/?quickstart-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&quickstart-all.sort-order=desc)

## 114. Elastic Beanstalk
More user friendly version of CloudFormation [link](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/getting-started/)

Exam Question: part of Compute services

Will include autoscaling features.

## 115. Highly Available Bastions
2 options for making a Bastion highly available:

option 1 (more expensive, use for Production environments)
- set up 2 bastions (in separate AZs)
- add a network load balancer with static IP to direct traffic

option 2 (cheaper, use for Dev/Test environments)
- set up Bastion via Autoscaling group
- set autoscaling to min/max == 1

## 116. On Premise Strategies
Database Migration Service (DMS)
- move databases into AWS

Server Migration Service (SMS)
- incremental replication into AWS

Application Discovery Service
- planning tool for enterprise customers
- includes installable data collection tool for mapping servers and dependencies

VM import/export
- use to backup VM images to/from AWS

## Quiz 7

Look out for GOTCHA questions
- list of steps to create a HA cluster, but omitted one (of multiple steps) for creating an AutoScaling group
- allow data loss of 0.1%, answer is based on difference in S3 options (95% vs 99% reliability)
- remember that RDS multiple AZ is a distinct service from read replicas

AWS Definitions for HA
- Availability - that the service will be available for use
- Durability - that a resource will exist till you remove it
- Resiliency - that the service will recover on failure
- Reliability - that the service will work as designed
