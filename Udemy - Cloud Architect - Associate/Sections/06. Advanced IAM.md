## 70. AWS Directory Service
Famiily of services
connects AWS resources with on-premises AD
allows SSO via corporate accounts

### AWS Managed Microsoft AD
- AWS managed Active Directory instance (hosted on VMs in cloud)
- AWS will manage servers (patching, etc.)
- Customer must manaage users, groups, etc.
- Customer must manage scaling

### Simple AD
Simpler implementation
Does not support TRUSTS (can't connect to another AD instance)

### AD Connector
Gateway for on-premise AD

### Cloud Directory
Directory based store (alternative to AD)
NOT related to AD

### Cognito User Pools
Managed user directory for SaaS applications
NOT related to AD

## 71. IAM Policies
ARN - Amazon Resource Name
`arn:partition:service:region:account_id:`

if a service is global, the region section is an empty string (resulting in a double colon `::`)
if a service is global and spans multiple accounts (eg S3), you can end up with 3 colons `:::`
a valude of `*` acts as a wildcard

Policy
- always in JSON format
- list of statements
- does not take effect till applied

statement breakdown:
```
{
  "Sid": "human readable string",
  "Effect": "Always either: 'Allow' or 'Deny'",
  "Action": [], // list of actions to allow or deny, supports `*` wildcard statements
  "Resource": "resource Arn" // resource the action(s) affect
}
```

Exam Tips
- explicit deny statement overrides any allow statements
- only attached policies have effect
- AWS will union all relevant policies

Permmission Boundaries
- delegates administration to non-admin users
- control maximum permissions an IAM policy can grant
- functions as whitelist permissions list (so a user with full administrator access can be restricted to 1+ services)
- use cases:
  - developers creating roles for Lambda functions
  - Admins creating adhoc users

## 72. Resources Access Manager (RAM)
Allows sharing between accounts

When sharing a resource, the 2nd user must accept the invitation from the 1st user before the resource will be available to access.

## 73. AWS Single Sign-On
