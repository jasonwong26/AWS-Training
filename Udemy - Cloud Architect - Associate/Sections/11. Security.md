## 126. Reducing Security Threats

Network Access Control List (NACL)
- can deny access to a known bad IP

Host-based firewall
- Windows fireWall, firewalld (linux), etc.
- runs on EC2 instance, can block known bad IP

Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- includes analytics AWS code to identify bad actors
- better option to NACL

## 127. Key Management Service (KMS)
Key management for encryption

stored as Customer Master Keys (CMK)

encrypting
- S3 objects
- database passwords
- API keys

pay per API call

Supports FIPS 1402 Level 2 auditing
- documentation that tampering occurred

3 types of CMK:

AWS Managed
- free
- managed by AWS

Customer Managed
- full control
- enables key rotation

AWS Owned
- invisible to clients

Encryption Key types:

Symmetric
- used for both encryption/decryption
- AES-256 based

Asymmetric
- Public/Private key pairs
- RSA or ECC based

Need to assign appropriate IAM permissions to enable apps to interact with KMS

CMKs are region specific
- moving an encrypted file from one region to another requires decrypting and re-encrypting using a key in the target region

use Aliases to faciliate key rotation

Exam Tip:
- Level 2 auditing == KMS

## 128. CloudHSM
Dedicated Hardware Security Module

Supports FIPS 1402 Level 3 auditing
- physical security measures (separate hardware, etc.)

CLoudHSM vs KMS
- Always manage your own keys
- runs within VPC in your account
- not highly available by defualt (you must set up multiple resources yourself)

## 129. Parameter Store
Component of AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

replaces config files
can store parameters in hierarchies (max 15 levels deep)
can track versions
can set TTL to enforce password rotation
