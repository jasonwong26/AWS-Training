## 118. SQS
Message Queue
Distributed system

Primary service for decoupling components

2 types of queues:

Standard Queues
- can deliver message more than once
- can deliver messages out of order (though generally in order)
- very high throughput

FIFO Queues
- ensures single delivery
- ensures message order
- limited throughput (300 transactions per second)

Exam Tips
- decoupling == SQS
- pull-based, not push based
- messages are 256 kb or less
- messages remain in queue for 1 minute to 14 days (default is 4 days)
- visibility timeout
  - locking time for a reader to process the task
  - duplicate messages occur when timeout < time needed to complete task
  - maximum timeout is 12 hours
- polling options
  - short (Default)
    - immediate response
    - returns empty if no tasks to complete
  - long
    - delayed response
    - only returns if a task exists to complete or timeout

## 118. SWF
Simple Workflow Service

Task based coordination service
- linked to human actions

vs SQS
- SWF has retention of up to 1 year, SQS rentention max is 14 days
- SWF = Task based API, SQS = message based API
- SWF ensures task is assigned only once.
- SWF tracks all tasks and events, SQS does not

SWF Actors
- Workflow Starters (initiates a workflow)
- Deciders (control flow)
- Activity Workers (carry out tasks)

## 120. SNS
Simple Notification Service

Event based coordination service

enables push notifications
enables SMS messages, email notifications

Exam Tips
- Push-based delivery
- SNS vs SQS
  - push vs pull
  - both messaging services

## 121. Elastic Transcoder

- convert media files to different formats

## 122. API Gateway
- can throttle requests to prevent attacks

API Caching
- cache in seconds at Gateway level

CORS on API Gateway
- add UI domain to allowed CORS list on API Gateway

## 123. Kinesis
processes data streams

3 types:

Kinesis Streams
- storage limit 7 days (default 24)
- groups data into shards
- exposes shards to data consumer(s)
- shards are only in Kinesis Streams

Kinesis Firehose
- no persistent storage
- immediate conversion to storage (S3, RDS, etc.)

Kinesis Analytics
- extension of Firehose
- convert input to analytics before storage
