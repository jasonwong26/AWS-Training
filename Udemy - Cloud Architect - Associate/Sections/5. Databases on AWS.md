## 57. Databases 101
6 types of relational databases on AWS
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Aurora
- Maria

Key features of relational databases
- Muliple AZ (availability zones)
- Read Replicas (for performance)
 - Max 5 replicas

Non Relational databases
- DynamoDb

Data Warehousing
- RedShift

OLTP vs OLAP
OLTP: Online Transaction Processing
OLAP: Online Analytics Processing

Memory Cache
- ElastiCache
  - two engines:
    - Memcache
    - Redis

### Exam Tips
- 6 flavors of Relational Databases
- Document database (DynamoDb)
- Data Warehousing (Redshift)
- Memory Cache (Elasticache)

## 58. Let's Creat an RDS Instance
Will default to Aurora (AWS product)

### Exam Tips
- RDS runs on virtual machines
- you cannot log into these machines (AWS managed)
- RDS is NOT serverless
  - exception: Aurora does have a serverless option

## 59. RDS Backups, Multi-AZ and Read Replicas
Automated backups
- retention period 1 - 35 days
- enabled by default

Database Snapshots
- manual process
- stored even after you delete the RDS

restoring a database from backup or snapshot will result in new instance

Encryption supported by all RDS versions.

Multi-AZ
- used for availability only, not performance

Read Replicas
- use for performance improvements
  - uses asynchronous replication
  - use for read heavy use cases
- must have automatic backups turned on
- Read Replicas can be multi-AZ
- Read Replicas can be in a separate region

## 60. RDS Backups, Multi-AZ & Read Replicas - Lab
### Exam Tips
2 types of backups
- Automated Backups
- Database snapshots

Read Replcias
- Can be multi-AZ
- Used to increase performance
- must have backups enabled
- can be in different regions
- does not support MS SQL Server
- Can be promoted to normal database (breaks replication)

Encryption at rest is enabled for all services

## 61. DynamoDb
- Stored on SSD storage
- Spread across 3 data centers
- Read behaviors
  - Eventual Consistent Reads (default) - replication happens up to 1 second
  - Strongly Consistent Reads - fastest response vs writes

## 62. Advanced DynamoDb
DAX - DynamoDB Accelerator
- 10x performance improvement
- no code changes to implement

Transactions
- can be used on DynamoDb
- can work on up two 25 actions (is this just batch write?)

Backup and Restore
- full backups at any time
- no impact on table performance
- retained until deleted

Point in Time Recovery
- not enabled by default
- can be used to restore back up to 35 days

Streams
- Stream Record = a database transaction
- Shared = a group of Stream Record

use cases for streams:
- aggregation
- auditing
- can be used in conjunction with Lambda to create stored procedures

Global Tables - Managed Multi-Master, Multi-Region Replication
- Globally distributed
- Based on DynamoDB streams (for replication)
- Multi-Region redundency
- No Applciation rewrites
- Replication latency under 1 second

DMS (Database Migration Service)
- Can be from OnPrem to AWS OR AWS database to a different database type

Encryption
- enabled by default

## 63. Redshift
Data warehouse service
- scales to petabytes or terabytes

Optimized for analytics queries

configuration options:
- single node
- multi node

compresses data based on columns rather than rows.

Supports parallel processing

Backups
- enabled by default, 1 day retention
- maximum retention period: 35 days

Pricing components
- Compute Node Hours
- Backups
- Data Transfers

Security
- encrypted at rest
- encrypted in transit via SSL

Exam Tips
- used for Business Intelligence
- Only available at 1 AZ
- Backups enabled by default with 1 day retention period
- Maximum retention period: 35 days
- Attempts to always maintain 3 copies of your data (original, replica, and backup on S3)
- Can asynconronously replicate snapshot to S3 in another region for disaster recovery

## 64. Aurora
AWS Proprietary database

Things to know:
- Starts at 10 GB, scales to 64 TB (autoscaling)
- Compute resources can scale to 32vCPUs and 244 GB memory
- 6 total copies of data: 2 copies of data in each availability zone, with minimum 3 avaiability zones

Backups
- occur automatically
- can create snapshots

Aurora Serverless
- exists
- cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads
- costs less than a reserved instance for certain scenarios

Exam Tips
- 6 total copies of data: 2 copies of data in each availability zone, with minimum 3 avaiability zones
- can take snapshots of Aurora, and share with other accounts
- 3 types of replicas available: Aurora, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
- has automated backups turned on by default
- cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads

## 65. Elasticache
In-Memory cache in cloud

### 2 caching engines
Memcache
- simpler option

Redis
- backups
- multiple Avaiability ones
- Ranking/Sorting
- Advanced datatypes
- Persistence
- Pub/Sub capability

## 66. Database Migration Services (DMS)
Supports heterogenous migrations
- MS SQL Server => Aurora

AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
- used to convert database for heterogenous migrations
- not needed for homogenous migrations (MySql => MySql)

Can import from other Cloud platforms like Azure

## 67. Caching Strategies on AWS
Caching services:
- CloudFront
- API Gateway
- ElastiCache
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Prioritize caching at outer level searches (CloudFront, API Gateway)

## 68. EMR Overview
Elastic Map Reduce

Big Data platform within AWS

Cluster
- Master Node - controller, tracks status of tasks & monitors overall health
- Core Node - runs tasks and stores data within the HAdoop Distributed File system (HDFS)
- Task Node - runs tasks but DOES NOT store data to HSFS

Clusters will always have a master node
Multi-server clusters will always have 1+ core node
Task nodes are always optional

By default logs are stored on Master Node.
to avoid loosing these, configure cluster to archive log files to S3.  Archiving can be done in 5 minute intervals.
MUST BE setup at cluster creation (cannot be changed later)

## 69. Databases Summary


## Quiz: Database on AWS
MySQL installation default port number
For Online Transaction Processing, exam expects RDS as the correct response
Provisioned IOPS is used to increase performance, so is useful for Online Transaction Processing
You do NOT need to specify port number for RDS security groups
