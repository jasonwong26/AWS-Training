## 75. DNS 101
Route53
- DNS is on port: 53
- reference is to Route 66

DNS Types ([wiki](https://www.cloudns.net/wiki/article/40/))
- SOA Record (State of Authority) - contains default TTL settings, owner email, other metadata
- NS Record (Name Server Record) - pointer in DNS registry to THEIR server that stores relevant information 
- ARecord (Address Record) - resolves DNS Name to IP Address of YOUR server
- CName (Canonical Name) - links related subnames.  Example: mobile.someplace.com => someplace.com
- Alias Records - like a CName, but more flexible.  use to link unrelated dns names.  Example: siteA.net => siteA.com
- MX Record (Mail Exchange Record) - pointer to mail server for domain
- PTR Record - enables reverse DNS lookup (IP address to DNS)

Typical default TTL for DNS entries is 48 hours
- this means changes to DNS can take 48 hours to complete

Exam Tips
- ELBs do not have pre-defined IP address, resolve them using a DNS name
- understand difference between Alias Record and CNAME
- Common DNS types (see above)
- It can take up to 3 days for changes to take effect

## 76. Route 53 - Register a Domain Name

## 77. Route 53 Routing Policies Available on AWS
Routing Policies
- Simple
- Weighted
- Latency-based
- Failover
- Geolocation
- Geoproximity

## 78. Simple Routing Policy Lab
returns IP addresses linked to DNS in random order

single ARecord with multiple IP Addresses assigned

## 79. Weighted Routing Policy Lab
Split traffic based on % of traffic (40% to server group A, 60% to server group B)

multiple ARecords with 1+ IP addresses assigned
- if weight values don't equal 100, actual split is based on value / total (eg 25|25 split == 50/50 split)

## 80. Latency Routing Policy
return IP address with lowest latency for user

multiple ARecords with 1+ IP addresses assigned

## 81. Failover Routing Policy
Active/Passive setup

multiple ARecords with 1+ IP addresses assigned, assign Primary|Secondary roles

## 82. Geolocation Routing Policy
route traffic by geographic zone (Europe, Asia, USA, etc.)
- can route by Continent or specific countries

use case: to display different content to European users vs American users

## 83. Geoproximity Routing Policy
Advanced option
- compares user location vs server location
- can adjust traffic flows by setting the `bias` value for each record

Must be set up using Route53 Traffic flow feature (not through direct record entry)


## 84. Multivalue Answer Policy
Similar to Simple Routing policy, but includes additional features:
- health check for each resource
- filters out unhealthy resources

multiple ARecords with 1 IP address assigned, requires health check for each record

## 85. Route53 Summary

- ELBs do not have pre-defined IP address, resolve them using a DNS name
- understand difference between Alias Record and CNAME (choose Alias in most situations)
- Common DNS types (see above)
- Types of routing (see above)

Health Checks
- Set up health checks on individual record sets
- If record fails health check it will be removed until it passes
- Can set SNS notifications when health check fails
