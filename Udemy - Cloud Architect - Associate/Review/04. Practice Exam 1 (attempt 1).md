## Question 21
**You are a developer at a fast-growing startup. 
Until now, you have used the root account to log in to the AWS console. 
However, as you have taken on more staff, you will need to stop sharing the root account to prevent accidental damage to your AWS infrastructure. 
What should you do so that everyone can access the AWS resources they need to do their jobs?
[Select 2]**

**Selected**:
- Create individual user accounts with minimum necessary rights and tell the staff to log in to the console using the credentials provided.
- Create a customized sign-in link such as "yourcompany.signin.aws.amazon.com/console" for your new users to use to sign in with.

**Answer**:
Selection is correct.

**Explanation**
Read the AWS Security Best Practice white paper. Also note that the IAM account signin URL is different from the Root account signin URL


## Question 22
**AWS provides a number of security-related managed services. 
From the options below, select which AWS service is related to protecting your infrastructure from which security issue. 
[Select 4]**

**Selected**: 
- AWS WAF protects from Cross-site Scripting attacks
- AWS Shield protects from Distributed Denail-of-Service attacks
- AWS WAF blocks IP addresses based on rules
- AWS Macie uses Machine Learning to protect sensitive data

**Answer**:
Selection is correct.

**Explanation**:
AWS provides various services to cope with many security related issues and because of this, there are a number of options which are correct. AWS Shield has two options listed above, but only one is correct. AWS Shield operates on layer 3 and 4 of the ISO network model and its primary purpose is to protect against DDoS attacks. It does not have any affect against SQL Injection attacks which are dealt with by AWS WAF. WAF also protects against Cross Site Scripting and can block traffic from IP addresses based on rules and therefore these options are also correct. Finally, Amazon Macie tackles a different problem related to Data Loss Prevention and protects sensitive data and so this answer is also correct.

## Question 27
**Your company has hired a young and enthusiastic accountant. 
After reviewing the AWS documentation and usage graphs, he announces that you are wasting vast amounts of money running your Windows servers for a full hour instead of spinning them up only when they are needed and down again as soon as they are idle for 1 minute. 
He cites the AWS claim that you only pay for what you use, and that as a senior engineer, you should be more conscious of wasting company money. How do you respond?**

**Selected**: 
You thank him for his concern, and advise him that he has misinterpreted the pricing document: Windows instances are billed by the full hour, and partial hours are billed as such. 
Additionally, storage charges are incurred even if the Db instance sits idle. 
Taking into account productivity losses, stopping and restarting Db instances may actually result in additional costs. 
As such, your solution is fine as it now stands.

**Answer**:
Selection is correct.

**Explanation**:
The study of AWS Billing is a discipline unto itself. For more information, please see the AWS Cost Control Course on the A Cloud Guru platform.

## Question 31
**Which of the following AWS services allow native encryption of data, while at rest? 
[Select 3]**

**Selected**: 
- S3
- Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Elastic File System (EFS)

**Answer**:
Selection is correct.

**Explanation**
EBS, S3 and EFS all allow the user to configure encryption at rest using either the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or, in some cases, using customer provided keys. The exception on the list is Elasticache for Memcached which does not offer a native encryption service, although Elasticache for Redis does.


## Question 32
**You've been tasked with building a new application with a stateless web tier for a company that produces reusable rocket parts. 
Which three services could you use to achieve this?**

**Selected**: 
RDS for structured data, DynamoDB for unstructured data ,and ElastiCache

**Notes**:
I didn't understand the question - none of the options seemed to relate to REST APIs

**Answer**:
Selection is correct.

**Explanation**:
The essence of a stateless installation is that the scalable components are disposable, and configuration is stored away from the disposable components. The best way to solve this type of problem is by elimination. Storage Gateway offers no advantage in this situation. CloudWatch is a reporting tool and will not help. An ELB will distribute load but will not really specific to stateless design. Elasticache is well suited for very short fast cycle data and is very suitable to replace in memory or on disk state data previously held on the web servers. RDS is well suited to structured and long cycle data, and DynamoDB is well suited for unstructured and medium cycle data. Both can be used for certain types of stateful data either in partner with or instead of Elasticache.

## Question 37
**Which of the following RDS database engines have a limit to the number of databases that can run per instance? 
[Select 2]**

**Selected**: 
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon Aurora

**Answer**:
SQL Server, Oracle

**Explanation**:
Both the Oracle and SQL Server database engines have limits to how many databases that can run per instance. Primarily, this is due to the underlying technology being proprietary and requiring specific licensing to operate. The database engines based on Open Source technology such as Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL have no such limits.

## Question 64
**You are a systems administrator and you need to monitor the health of your production environment. 
You decide to do this using CloudWatch. 
However, you notice that you cannot see the health of every important metric in the default dashboard. 
When monitoring the health of your EC2 instances, for which of the following metrics do you need to design a custom CloudWatch metric?**

**Selected**: 
Disk read operations

**Answer**:
Memory Usage

**Explanation**
Remember under the shared security model that AWS can see the instance, but not inside the instance to what it is doing. 
AWS can see that you have Memory, but how much of the memory is being used cannot be seen by AWS. 
In the case of CPU AWS can see how much of CPU you are using, but cannot see what you are using if for.

## Question 68
**In AWS Route 53, which of the following are true?
[Select 2]**

**Selected**: 
- Alias Records can point at any resource with a Canonical Name.
- Route 53 allows you to create an Alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace (zone apex).

**Answer**:
- Alias Records provide a Route 53-specific extension to DNS functionality
- Route 53 allows you to create an Alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace (zone apex).

**Explanation**
Alias Records have special functions that are not present in other DNS servers. Their main function is to provide special functionality and integration into AWS services. Unlike CNAME records, they can also be used at the Zone Apex, where CNAME records cannot. Alias Records can also point to AWS Resources that are hosted in other accounts by manually entering the ARN
