# S3
[FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/)

## S3 Options
### Standard
- Availability - 99.9%
- durability - 99.999999999% (11 x 9)

Highest cost, highest performance

### IA (Infrequently Accessed)
- Availability - 99.9%
- durability - 99.999999999% (11 x 9)

Lower cost depending on access patterns (charge by retrieval)

### One Zone IA
- Availability - 99.5%
- durability - 99.999999999% (11 x 9)

Lower cost depending on access patterns (charge by retrieval)
Lower avaiability due to single Availability Zone

### Glacier
- Availability - 99.9%
- durability - 99.999999999% (11 x 9)

Even lower cost, meant for data archival

### Glacier Deep Archive
- lowest cost
- retrieval time is 12 hours

## EC2
Fight Dr. McPixz AU - envision a scottish pixie wearing a doctor's outfit with gloves in Australia

F - for FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) - used for genomics research, financial analytics, etc.            
I - for IOPS - used for NoSQL DBs, Data Warehousing
G - Graphics Intensive - used for Video Encoding
H - High Disc Throughput - used for MapReduce-based workloads
T - Cheap general Purpose - used for Web Servers
D - For Density - used for File Servers
R - For RAM - For Memory Intensive Apps / Databases
M - Main choice for general purpose apps - for Application Servers
C - For Compute - For CPU intensive Apps / Databases
P - Graphics (GPU) - For Machine Learning, Bit Coin Mining
X - Extreme Mmory - Apache, Spark, etc.
Z - Extreme Memory AND CPU - ???
A - ARM-Based Workloads - ???
U - Bare Metal - ???

### Storage Types
- EBS (Elastic Block Store) - a virtual hard disk (available to single EC2)
- EFS (Elastic File System) - virtual hard disk that can be shared
- FSx (???) - windows native file storage
- FSX for Lustre - use for compute-intensive workloads

### Placement Groups
- Clustered - single AZ, use for low network latency, high network throughput
- Spread - single AZ, separate racks for durablity.  limit 1 per rack
- Partitioned - single AZ, separate racks for durability.  allows multiple per rack.

# Databases
## Relational
Relational databases are NOT serverless (exception: Aurora can be).
Automated backups enabled by default (retention period 1 - 35 days).

Read Replicas vs Multi-AZ
- Multi-AZ - for improving availability ONLY
- Read Replicas - for performance (asyncronous replication)

Common Database ports:
- MS SQL - 1433
- MySQL - 3306
- Aurora / PostgreSQL - 5432

## Non-Relational
Read behaviors
- Eventual Consistent Reads (default) - replication happens up to 1 second
- Strongly Consistent Reads - fastest response vs writes

## Redshift
Optimized for analytics queries

- used for Business Intelligence
- Only available at 1 AZ
- Backups enabled by default with 1 day retention period
- Maximum retention period: 35 days
- Attempts to always maintain 3 copies of your data (original, replica, and backup on S3)
- Can asynconronously replicate snapshot to S3 in another region for disaster recovery

## Aurora
AWS Proprietary database
- Autoscales up to 64 TB
- includes serverless option

## Elasticache
options:
- Memcache (simplest option)
- Redis (much more configurable)

## Route 53
DNS Types ([wiki](https://www.cloudns.net/wiki/article/40/))
- SOA Record (State of Authority) - contains default TTL settings, owner email, other metadata
- NS Record (Name Server Record) - pointer in DNS registry to THEIR server that stores relevant information 
- ARecord (Address Record) - resolves DNS Name to IP Address of YOUR server
- CName (Canonical Name) - links related subnames.  Example: mobile.someplace.com => someplace.com
- Alias Records - like a CName, but more flexible.  use to link unrelated dns names.  Example: siteA.net => siteA.com
- MX Record (Mail Exchange Record) - pointer to mail server for domain
- PTR Record - enables reverse DNS lookup (IP address to DNS)

Routing Policies (relevant when resolving to multiple IPs)
- Simple - returns in random order
- Weighted - splits traffic basedon percentage (50/50 split, etc.)
- Latency-based- returns IP with lowest latency for request
- Failover - active/passive setup
- Geolocation - route based on geographic zone (use to display different content by region)
- Geoproximity - most advanced option

Health Checks
- Set up health checks on individual record sets
- If record fails health check it will be removed until it passes
- Can set SNS notifications when health check fails

## VPCs

Security Groups are Stateful, Access Control Lists are Stateless 
- stateful = inbound/outbound communication paths are paired

## HA Architecture
[FAQ link](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/faqs/)

### Load Balancer types
Application Load Balancer
- designed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- operate at Layer 7
- application aware (can see into applicaiton content)

Network Load Balancer
- best for TCP traffic where extreme performance is needed
- Operates at layer 4 (connection level)

Classic Load Balancer
- legacy elastic load balancer
- not application aware
- if application stops responding, you will get a 504 error

Logging client IP addresses
- look for X-Forwarded-For address (base IP will be the load balancer)

### Auto Scaling
Terms
- Groups - logic component of resources
- Configuration Templates - specify template to launch additional resources as needed
- Scaling Options - rules to control when/how to spin up/down resources  (as needed, on schedule, etc.)

scaling options:
- maintain levels (no scaling) - AWS will terminate unhealthy instances and launch a replacement
- manual scaling
- scheduled scaling
- demand based scaling
- predictive scaling

## SQS
- pull-based, not push based
- messages are 256 kb or less
- messages remain in queue for 1 minute to 14 days (default is 4 days)

2 types of queues:

Standard Queues
- can deliver message more than once
- can deliver messages out of order (though generally in order)
- very high throughput

FIFO Queues
- ensures single delivery
- ensures message order
- limited throughput (300 transactions per second)

## SNS
Event based coordination service
- Push-based delivery
- enables push notifications for mobile
- enables SMS messages, email notifications

## Fargate
Terms to know:

- Cluster - logical collection of resources (either EC2 or Fargate)
- Task Definition - like a Dockerfile, but can contain multiple containers
- Container Definition - definition of an individual container (part of Task Definition)
- Task - instance of a spun up Task Definition
- Service - manages scaling
- Registry - storage repository for images (ether Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or Docker Hub)
